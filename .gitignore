#   For a library or tool, you might want to ignore these files since the code is intended to run in multiple environments; 
#   otherwise, check in the pyenv configuration files, especially if you are in an isolated environment.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies 
#   not cross-compatible, pipenv may install dependencies that are not in line with the rest of the team.
